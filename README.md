# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the recognition of Michigan license plates using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. The system preprocesses images under varying conditions, normalizes them for better accuracy, and then detects and locates the license plate within the image. It further segments the characters on the plate, enabling separate recognition of numbers and letters. For the recognition phase, a custom dataset of characters (0-9, A-Z) is created, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or other optimized models are employed to accurately identify each character.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, the system will be capable of:
- Detecting Michigan state license plates from images.
- Recognizing the letters, numbers, and special symbols (e.g., the disabled sign) on the plate.
- Potentially extending functionality to include real-time video recognition, different state recognition, car brand identification, and converting license plates to text in real-time.

## Societal Impact

The ALPR system has the potential to significantly enhance the automation of parking systems. Compared to traditional systems that rely on physical cards or manual ticketing, this vision-based system offers a more efficient and cost-effective solution. It can improve user convenience by eliminating the need for physical cards, streamline entry during high-traffic events, and increase security by making it harder to fabricate access permits. This system is particularly beneficial in Michiganâ€™s cold winters, reducing the need for physical interaction with parking machines.
